# Jam's Portfolio

Trying out Google's website template thing - http://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit

Template good. Gulp bad.

##  Build

To build the site you will need...

- node [http://nodejs.org/]
- ruby [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/]
- gulp [http://gulpjs.com/]
- sass gem [http://sass-lang.com/install]

Once you've cloned this repository, `cd jamjamjamjam`, then run `npm install` to download the biz.

## Development

gulpfile.js contains all the build configuration. Some useful commands are...

`gulp serve` - starts a webserver in app/ and opens a browser

`gulp` - builds production assets into dist/

`gulp serve:dist` - builds production assets, and starts a webserver in dist/
